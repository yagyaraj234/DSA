The arrangement and organizing  of the data inside main memory for the efficiently utilization by the application that arrangement is call data Structure.




        Static Vs Dynamic Memory Allocation 

Stack Vs Heap   



  Stack
The variable declare in the code or main function the memory will be allocated inside the stack.

The portion of memory allocated to main function in  called activation record of that function.

 
        Heap

Heap is used from organized and unorganized memory.
Heap memory is used as a resource when it is required it used when it not required destroy the memory.

Program cannot directly Access heap memory.We can access heap memory using pointer.


Allocation of memory in heap ;

int main(){
    int *p;
    p=new int[5];
}

delete []p; // delete the memory
p=Null // Deallocation of memory

The above Statement create a memory of an array inside the heap.



Types of Ds-
1. Physical Data Structure
    a). array
    b). Linked List
2. Logiacal Data Structure
    a). Stack    // Lifo - Last in First Out
    b). Queues   // Fifo - Firat in First Out
    c). Trees
    d). Graph
    e). Hash Table

  *  Stack and Queues are linear Data Structure
  *  Trees and Graph are Non-linear Data Structure
  *  Hash Table is a tabular Data Structure



Abstract DataType (ADT)

1. represtation of data.
2. operations on data.
